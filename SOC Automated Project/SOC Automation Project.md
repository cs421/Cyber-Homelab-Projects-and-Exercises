**Goal:** The goal of this project is to create an automated SOC analyst lab with **Wazuh** as the SIEM tool, **TheHive** as the case management tool, and **Shuffle** for SOAR capabilities. This lab will also utilize **Mimikatz** as the sample credential harvesting attack.

I will be following **MyDFIR's** videos on creating this lab, as found in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb_ukgtYK_U
